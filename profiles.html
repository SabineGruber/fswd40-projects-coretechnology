                    Patrick's technical journey started around 10 years ago.
                    <br> From different operating Systems to 3D Design and HTML4, he tried all.
                    <br> His interests moved, and focused on Webdevelopment and Design.
                    <br>
                    <br> After reading many sites online and playing around with the new knowledge, he started as a freelancer in late 2015.
                    <br> With some experience and a handful of clients he decided to move forward, and to bring his knowledge on a more professional level.
                    <br>
                    <br> Currently Patrick is studying at the "Code Factory" in vienna, prepareing himself for new opportunities.
